<li>JavaScript: an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</li>
<li>Operator: +, -, *, /, and % are called operators. An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed. </li>
<li>Variables: Variables can be thought of as containers used to store information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name.</li>
<li>Lower camel case: Use lowerCamelCase when naming JavaScript variables. Start with a lowercase letter, and if the variable name is more than one word, remove all spaces and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.</li>
<li>Function: A function is a block of code that performs an action and returns a result; optionally takes arguments</li>
<li>Methods:  A method is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</li>
<li>Arguments: Some methods take one or more arguments that provide the method with additional information to help it perform its action.</li>
<li>Parameters: Is a variable that's assigned to the argument.</li>
<li>Return value: The return value is the method's response.</li>
<li>Chaining methods: Calling a method directly on the return value of another method.</li>
<li>Strings: a JavaScript data type that represents the exact text of whatever is enclosed in the quotes</li>
<li>Boolean: true and false are booleans. They are not strings - they simply represent being true or false.</li>
<li>Undefined: An object (such as a variable) without a defined value.</li>
<li>NaN 0 / 0: returns NaN, which stands for not a number. NaN is a type of number.</li>
<li>Concatenation: Combining two Strings together into one String.</li>
<li>Comment: anything following // on a line in JavaScript is ignored by the computer. Comments are a convenient way to leave notes in your code for yourself or other programmers.</li>
<li>User interface logic: The code responsible for the interaction between the user and the application; handles tasks such as event listening, user input forms, DOM manipulation, display and styling. We have not covered how to write the actual code for this yet; don't worry!
</li>
<li>Business logic: The code responsible for handling the evaluation and manipulation of data; does not require any user interface.</li>
